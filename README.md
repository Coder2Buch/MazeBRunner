This game was created as a 2-4 players Mazerunner experience with Mario Cart Style boxes to randomly generate items that help you fight other Players that you meet on your way to the exit.
The exit gets randomly generated at set locations inside the labyrinth and players have to get there first to achieve victory.
In this video a quick Overview over UI / Gameplay / Splitscreen function / Controller support is provided to further understand the mechanics
